## Dataset: Diamonds

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://rnabioco.github.io/bmsc-7810-pbda/posts/2022-11-23-class-6-intro-to-ggplot2-part3/img/diamond.png")
#source: 123dartist/stock.adobe.com
```

A dataset containing the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000
diamonds.

```{r}
head(diamonds)
```

A data frame with 53940 rows and 10 variables:

price = price in US dollars (\$326--\$18,823)

carat = weight of the diamond (0.2--5.01)

cut = quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)

color = diamond color, from D (best) to J (worst)

clarity = a measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2,
SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))

x = length in mm (0--10.74)

y = width in mm (0--58.9)

z = depth in mm (0--31.8)

depth = total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y) = 2 \* z / (x + y)
(43--79)

table = width of top of diamond relative to widest point (43--95)

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Exercise: Review the last class. Make a histogram showing the
distribution of diamond prices. Color by the cut of the diamond. What
statements can you make about the relationships shown.

```{r}

```

Exercise: More review. Create a freqpoly plot showing the frequency
count of the carat and the color as the cut of diamond. Does this help
explain the ideal cut price?

```{r}

```

There are so many data points in this dataset as seen by our original
scatterplot. Before moving on we can subset this dataset by using sample
to grab a random selection of 1000 rows for downstream analysis.

```{r}
set.seed(1337) # set the random seed so that we get the same random rows everytime

subset_diamonds <- diamonds[sample(nrow(diamonds), 1000), ]

ggplot(subset_diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price)) + 
  geom_point()

```

## Introducing the Facet

One way that we can take an attribute from your data and expand it to
plot it into multiple plots, one for each level, letting you view them
separately. Just as a cut diamond has different flat edges called
facets, in ggplot this type of breaking out the levels of the data into
multiple plots is called "faceting". One of the easiest ways to do this
is by using the `facet_wrap()` function.

```{r}
ggplot(subset_diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price, color=cut)) +
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~cut, nrow = 1)
```

The second type of facet function is the `facet_grid()`

```{r}
ggplot(subset_diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price, color=cut)) +
  geom_point() + 
  facet_grid(clarity ~ cut)
```

This is a good time to introduce a way to modify the size of the figure
being displayed in RMarkdown. We can edit the curly braces to give
special instructions for the cell. Kent has previous showed this to you
as well. Here we can add `fig.width=20` to increase the width of the
figure. You can also try `fig.height`. There are numerous ways you can
influence the plot using this format and most of them start with the
`fig.` prefix.

```{r fig.width=20,}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price, color=cut)) +
  geom_point() + 
  facet_grid(clarity ~ cut)
```

Exercise: Use the dataset from last class `iris`. Make a scatterplot of
Sepal Width and Sepal Length and color by the Species. Use a
`facet_wrap` to break out the Species.

```{r}

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Saving Plot Objects

One concept that can be useful is that you can assign ggplot plots to a
variable just like any other object in R. This can allow you to reuse
the plot over and over again simply by calling the variable name you
saved the plot. You can also continue to add layers to these plots and
can we a quick way to test and compare different versions of a plot.

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(subset_diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price, color=cut)) +
  geom_point()
```

Notice that nothing was plotting when you run this code. Instead the
plot is saved to the `p1` variable. We can visualize this plot anytime
simply by calling the variable.

```{r}
p1
```

We can add any additional layers just as we would when building the
plot. Let's look at a `facet_wrap` of the `clarity.`

```{r}
p1 + facet_wrap(~clarity)
```

We changed our mind and now we want to compare this to the same base
plot but use a `facet_grid` breaking out the diamond color.

```{r}
p1 + facet_grid(clarity~color)
```

## Color Palettes

You can easily change the types and ranges of colors being used in your
plots. Here is the default color palette:

```{r}
ggplot(subset_diamonds, aes(carat, price, color = clarity)) +
  geom_point()
```

We can use the `scale_color_brewer()` to set a different type of
palette. There are many default options to choose from and maybe more
custom ones you can install.

<https://r-graph-gallery.com/38-rcolorbrewers-palettes.html>

```{r}
ggplot(subset_diamonds, aes(carat, price, color = clarity)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "RdYlBu")
```

```{r}
ggplot(subset_diamonds, aes(carat, price, color = clarity)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Accent")
```

```{r}
ggplot(subset_diamonds, aes(carat, price, color = clarity)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("red", "blue", "green", "yellow", "purple", "white", "black", "gray"))
```

## Themes

One of the most fun aspects of ggplot is the ability to quickly change
the entire look of your plots with themes.

```{r}
ptest <- ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Width, y=Sepal.Length, color = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ Species)

ptest
```

```{r}
ptest + theme_dark()
```

```{r}
ptest + theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
ptest + theme_bw()
```

```{r}
ptest + theme_classic()
```

```{r}
ptest + theme_void()
```

You can install custom themes....

## Combining multiple plots

One useful technique when assembling figures is to be able to stitch
multiple plots together into a single image. There is a special add on
package that allows us to do just that with simple syntax. This package
is called `patchwork` and will need to be installed as it is not
included in the `tidyverse`. It can be installed with
`install.packages("patchwork")`. More info at
<https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/>

```{r}
library(patchwork)
```

Save the plots as object variables.

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(mtcars) + 
  geom_point(aes(mpg, disp))

p2 <- ggplot(mtcars) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(gear, disp, group = gear))
```

To use patchwork simply place the plus operator to "add" two plots
together:

```{r}
p1 + p2
```

Why stop at just two plots? We can keep adding more.

```{r}
p3 <- ggplot(mtcars) + 
  geom_smooth(aes(disp, qsec))

p4 <- ggplot(mtcars) + 
  geom_bar(aes(carb))
```

And use more complex ways of displaying them.

```{r}
(p1 + p2 + p3) / p4
```

To annotate the whole group we need to use a special `plot_annotation()`
function:

```{r}
(p1 | p2 | p3) / p4 + 
  plot_annotation(
  title = 'The surprising truth about mtcars',
  subtitle = 'These 3 plots will reveal yet-untold secrets about our beloved data-set',
  caption = 'Disclaimer: None of these plots are insightful')
```

You can even automatically add the subplot letter annotations. Publish
time!

```{r}
(p1 | p2 | p3) / p4 + 
  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')
```

```{r}
(p1 | p2 | p3) / p4 + 
  plot_annotation(title = "Figure 1: Motor Trend 1974 Car Stats", tag_levels = 'A')
```

Exercise: Change the order of the plots combined with patchwork so that
p4 is in the middle of the top row and p2 is now on the bottom row. See
how the plot adapts.

```{r}

```

Thanks for listening. Keep on plotting and exploring the world of
ggplot2!
