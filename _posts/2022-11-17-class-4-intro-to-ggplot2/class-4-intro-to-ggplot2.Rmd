## The ggplot2 Package

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path="https://github.com/rnabioco/bmsc-7810-pbda/blob/main/_posts/2022-11-17-class-4-intro-to-ggplot2/img/ggplot2.png?raw=true")
```

This package allows you to declaratively create graphics by giving a set
of variables to map to aesthetics and then layer graphical directives to
produce a plot. It's part of the tidyverse of R packages for data
science and analysis, sharing in their design philosophy. It's an
alternative to the built in R graphics and plotting functions.\

## Grammar of Graphics

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/rnabioco/bmsc-7810-pbda/blob/main/_posts/2022-11-17-class-4-intro-to-ggplot2/img/grammargraphics.jpg?raw=true")
```

-   Grammar gives languages rules.
-   Grammar has a technical meaning.
-   Grammar makes language expressive.

## Layers of ggplot2

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/rnabioco/bmsc-7810-pbda/blob/main/_posts/2022-11-17-class-4-intro-to-ggplot2/img/gglayers-qcbscaworkshop.png?raw=true")
# source: https://r.qcbs.ca/workshop03/book-en/grammar-of-graphics-gg-basics.html
```

## Basic Grammar

**Plot = data + aesthetics + geometry**

**data** = the dataset, typically a dataframe\
**aesthetics** = map variables x and y to axis\
**geometry** = type of graphic or plot to be rendered

**facets** = multiple plots\
**statistics** = add calculations\
**theme** = make the plot pretty or follow a particular style

```{r}
# ggplot(<DATA>, aes(<MAPPINGS>)) + <GEOM_function>()

?ggplot # bring up the ggplot function help
```

## Consider the Type of Data you want to plot

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/rnabioco/bmsc-7810-pbda/blob/main/_posts/2022-11-17-class-4-intro-to-ggplot2/img/whattoplot.png?raw=true")

```

## Data to Plot

To begin plotting we need to start with some data to visualize. Here we
can use a built-in dataset regarding Motor Trend Car Road Tests called
`mtcars`. This dataset is a dataframe which is a key format for using
with ggplot. We can preview the data structure using the `head()`
function.

```{r}
#some built in data.

head(mtcars)
```

The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and
comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and
performance for 32 automobiles (1973--74 models).

A data frame with 32 observations on 11 (numeric) variables.

[, 1] mpg = Miles/(US) gallon\
[, 2] cyl = Number of cylinders\
[, 3] disp = Displacement (cu.in.)\
[, 4] hp = Gross horsepower\
[, 5] dra = Rear axle ratio\
[, 6] wt = Weight (1000 lbs)\
[, 7] qsec = 1/4 mile time\
[, 8] vs = Engine (0 = V-shaped, 1 = straight)\
[, 9] am = Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)\
[,10] gear = Number of forward gears\
[,11] carb = Number of carburetors\
**-R Documentation**

## Basic Plot

Using the basic ggplot grammar of graphics template we can produce a
scatterplot from the dataframe.

```{r}
# ggplot(<DATA>, aes(<MAPPINGS>)) + <GEOM_function>()
```

The first part of the expression calls the `ggplot` function and takes
the `dataframe` and the `aes` function which are the aesthetics
mappings. In this case we are mapping the x-axis to be the `wt` variable
and the y-axis to be the `mpg` variable . If you only evaluate the first
part this is what you get:

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg))
```

Next we have to add the geometry layer to be able to actually see the
data. Here we are adding the `geom_point` geometry which allows you to
visualize the data as points. You use a plus sign to add these
additional layers.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg)) + geom_point()
```

We can change the data being plotted by picking a different column from
the dataframe. For instance here we are plotting the horsepower(hp)
versus miles per gallon(mpg). Also note that we can make the code more
readable by placing proceeding layers on a different line after the plus
sign. A common error is misplacing the plus sign. It must be trailing on
the line before the next layer.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=hp, y=mpg)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Exercise: Try building a scatterplot on your own. This time plot the
variables corresponding to the number of cylinders and the type of
transmission.

```{r}

```

Exercise: Modify the scatterplot to plot horsepower instead of the type
of transmission. Can you start to see a relationship with the data?

## Adding Additional Information to the Plot

### Title

We can add a title to the plot simply by adding another layer and the
`ggtitle()` function.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=hp, y=mpg)) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("1974 Cars: Horsepower vs Miles Per Gallon")
```

### X and Y axis Labels

We can overwrite the default labels and add our own to the x and y axis
by using the `xlab()` and `ylab()` functions respectively.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=hp, y=mpg)) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("1974 Cars: Horsepower vs Miles Per Gallon") +
  ylab("miles per gallon") + 
  xlab("horsepower")
```

### Set title and axis labels in one layer

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=hp, y=mpg, alpha = 0.5)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Horepower", 
    y = "Miles Per Gallon", 
    title = "Horsepower vs Miles Per Gallon Scatterplot",
    subtitle = "Motor Trend Car Road Tests - 1974",
    caption = "Smith et al. 1974")
```

Notice that we also added an alpha aesthetic which helps us visualize
overlapping points. We can add a `show.legend = FALSE` argument to the
`geom_point` function to remove the alpha legend and clean up the plot
figure. Let's try it. You can also specify a vector of aesthetics to
display.

Check the documentation `?geom_point`.

### Getting Geometry Specific Help

We can easily add a third bit of information to the plot by using the
color aesthetic. Each geometry has its own list of aesthetics that you
can add and modify. Consult the help page for each one.

```{r}
?geom_point() # bring up the help page for geom_point()
```

### Adding the Color Aesthetic

Here we are adding the color aesthetic.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=hp, y=mpg, color=cyl)) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Modern Cars: Horsepower vs Miles Per Gallon") +
  ylab("miles per gallon") + 
  xlab("horsepower")
```

And we can relabel the legend title for the new color aesthetic to make
it more readable.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=hp, y=mpg, color=cyl)) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Modern Cars: Horsepower vs Miles Per Gallon") +
  ylab("miles per gallon") + 
  xlab("horsepower") +
  labs(color="#cylinders")
```

### A Fourth Aesthetic

You can even continue to add even more information to the plot through
additional aesthetics. Though this might be a bit much.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=hp, y=mpg, color=cyl, size = wt)) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Modern Cars: Horsepower vs Miles Per Gallon") +
  ylab("miles per gallon") + 
  xlab("horsepower") +
  labs(color="#cylinders", size="weight (x1000lb)")
```

Instead we can use a specific value instead of the **wt** variable to
adjust the size of the dots.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=hp, y=mpg, color=cyl, size = 3)) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Modern Cars: Horsepower vs Miles Per Gallon") +
  ylab("miles per gallon") + 
  xlab("horsepower") +
  labs(color="#cylinders")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Other Geometries

There are many other geometries that you can use in your plots.
<https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference>\
Here is a short list:

geom_point(): scatterplot\
geom_line(): lines connecting points by increasing value of x\
geom_path(): lines connecting points in sequence of appearance\
geom_boxplot(): box and whiskers plot for categorical variables\
geom_bar(): bar charts for categorical x axis\
geom_col(): bar chart where heights of the bars represent values in the
data\
geom_histogram(): histogram for continuous x axis\
geom_violin(): distribution kernel of data dispersion\
geom_smooth(): function line based on data\
geom_bin2d(): heatmap of 2d bin counts\
geom_contour(): 2d contours of a 3d surface\
geom_count(): count overlapping points\
geom_density(): smoothed density estimates\
geom_dotplot(): dot plot\
geom_hex(): hexagonal heatmap of 2d bin counts\
geom_freqpoly(): histogram and frequency polygons\
geom_jitter(): jittered point plot geom_polygon(): polygons

### geom_line()

But utilizing the right plot to efficiently show your data is key. Here
we swapped the geom_point for geom_line to see what would happen. You
could also try something like geom_bin2d()

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=hp, y=mpg, color=cyl)) + 
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle("Modern Cars: Horsepower vs Miles Per Gallon") +
  ylab("miles per gallon") + 
  xlab("horsepower") +
  labs(color="#cylinders")
```

### Plotting the Categories as a Bar Chart with geom_col()

The geom_col() geometry is a type of bar plot that uses the heights of
the bars to represent values in the data. Let's look at plotting this
type of data for the cars in this dataset.

```{r}
?geom_col()
```

```{r}
head(mtcars)
```

Looking back at the data structure of mtcars, we see that the names of
the cars are stored as the row names of the data frame. We can access
this using the `rownames()`function and use it in subsequent plots.

Q: What was another way to address this issue, discussed in the first
block?

```{r}
rownames(mtcars)
```

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=rownames(mtcars), y=mpg)) + 
  geom_col() +
  ggtitle("1974 Cars: Miles Per Gallon")
```

You will learn other ways to make this more legible later. For a quick
fix we can swap the x and y mappings.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(y=rownames(mtcars), x=mpg)) + 
  geom_col() +
  ggtitle("1974 Cars: Miles Per Gallon")

```

We can reorder the data to make it easier to visualize important
information.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(y=reorder(rownames(mtcars), mpg), x=mpg)) + 
  geom_col() +
  ggtitle("1974 Cars: Ranked by Miles Per Gallon")

```

Exercise: Plot a bar chart using geom_col() with the mtcar dataset. Plot
the names of the cars ranked by the weight of each car. Try adding a
third aesthetic `color` for horsepower.

```{r}

```

## Multiple Geometries

You can also add another layer of geometry to the same ggplot. Notice
you can have two separate aesthetic declarations and they have moved
from the ggplot function to their respective `geom_ functions`.

```{r}
# ggplot(data = <DATA>, mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>)) + 
#   <GEOM_FUNCTION1>() + 
#   <GEOM_FUNCTION2>() 

# OR

# ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
#   <GEOM_FUNCTION1>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>)) + 
#   <GEOM_FUNCTION2>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>)) 

ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_point(aes(x=hp, y=mpg)) +
  geom_line(aes(x=hp, y=mpg, color=cyl)) +
  ggtitle("Modern Cars: Horsepower vs Miles Per Gallon") +
  ylab("miles per gallon") + 
  xlab("horsepower") +
  labs(color="#cylinders")
```

This particular geometry addition isn't very useful.

Exercise: Try adding geom_smooth() instead of geom_line().

## Saving Plots

Saving these plots is easy! Simply call the `ggsave()` function to save
the last plot that you created. You can specify the file format by
changing the extension after the filename.

```{r}
ggsave("plot.png") # saves the last plot to a PNG file in the current working directory
```

You can also specify the dots per inch and the width of height of the
image to ensure publication quality figures upon saving.

```{r}
ggsave("plot-highres.png", dpi = 300, width = 8, height = 4) # you can specify the dots per inch (dpi) and the width and height parameters
```

Exercise: Try saving the last plot that we produced as a jpg. Can you
navigate to where it saved and open it on your computer?
