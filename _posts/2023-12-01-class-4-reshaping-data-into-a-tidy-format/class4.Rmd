## Wide versus long data formats

Data can be represented in multiple formats. Today we will discuss two common tabular formats for organizing data for analysis.

Consider the following dataset, which contains population estimates for countries throughout history. This representation of data is commonly referred to as 'wide' data format, which is a matrix-like format containing samples as rows and features as columns, with values associated with each observation of a sample and feature. 

```{r}
library(readr)
pop_wide <- read_csv("data/country_population.csv")
pop_wide
```

The wide matrix-like format is very useful and a common format used for statistics and machine learning. Matrices can take advantage of optimized numerical routines and are the data representation of mathematical matrices. We will work with matrices later in class, particularly with their use to generate heatmaps. 

Representing data in a matrix however has a few practical implications:  

1) There is only 1 type of data stored in a matrix-like representation (e.g. each cell is the same unit of observation, the population per country). To store additional related data types (e.g. the countries GDP each year) you need to place each new value in an independent matrix.  

2) The matrix-like format does not easily lend itself to more complicated summaries. For example, what if we wanted to average the GDP values for each decade or century? We would have to write rather complicated code to parse out subsets of columns for each time period, average them, then merge them into a summary matrix. 

Data in a matrix can be instead formatted into a long (also called "tidy") format. 

```r
#> # A tibble: 10 × 3
#>    country     year  population
#>    <chr>       <chr>      <dbl>
#>  1 Afghanistan 1800     3280000
#>  2 Afghanistan 1801     3280000
#>  3 Afghanistan 1802     3280000
#>  4 Afghanistan 1803     3280000
#>  5 Afghanistan 1804     3280000
#>  6 Afghanistan 1805     3280000
#>  7 Afghanistan 1806     3280000
#>  8 Afghanistan 1807     3280000
#>  9 Afghanistan 1808     3280000
#> 10 Afghanistan 1809     3280000
```

The long format of this data convert the many columns of a matrix into a 3 column data.frame containing 3 variables (`country`, `year`, and `population`). 

## Tidy data format

>“Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.” –– Hadley Wickham

A tidy dataset is structured in a manner to be most effectively processed in R using the tidyverse. For example, with the population dataset, instead of having to provide logic to process 100s of columns, instead there are only 3 columns.

Most data tables that you've worked with are probably not tidy. It takes experience to understand the best way to format the data for data processing. As you work more in R and the tidyverse this will become more natural. 

Tidy data has the following attributes:

1) Each variable must have its own column.  
2) Each observation must have its own row.  
3) Each value must have its own cell.  

What is a variable, what is an observation, and what is a value?

1) A value is a number or word, e.g. the population.   

2) Every value belongs to a variable and an observation, e.g. the population value observed in Austria in the year 1910.  

3) A variable contains all values that measure the same attribute (e.g. height, temperature, duration, magnitude) across units.  (e.g. Austria is a value of the country variable, 1910 is a value of the year variable).

4) An observation contains all values measured on the same unit across attributes (e.g observations about Austria in 1910).  


```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rnabioco/bmsc-7810-pbda/main/_posts/2023-12-01-class-4-reshaping-data-into-a-tidy-format/img/tidydata.png")
```

Shown below is a simplified data table in a tidy format, provided by the `tidyr` package. This data table shows the # of TB cases documented by the WHO in a few countries in the years 1999 and 2000.

```{r}
library(tidyr)
table1
```

The same data, represented in wide, matrix-like format, would require 2 tables:

e.g a table with the `cases` values per country.

```{r}
table4a
```
e.g a table with the `population` values per country   

```{r}
table4b
```

What advantages does the tidy format provide? 

1) Easy to generate summaries of the data. 
   e.g. via `group_by()` -> `summarize()`
   
2) Easy to plot the data using the ggplot2 framework (more on that in later classes)

3) Very easy to join multiple related data frames based on key values.

Some disadvantages: 

1) Not space efficient  

2) Not intuitive   

3) Doesn't interface well with traditional machine learning and statistical approaches.  


## Converting between long and wide formats using tidyr 

The [`tidyr`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) package provides functionality to convert datasets into tidy formats. 

- `pivot_longer()`: convert wide data to long data  
- `pivot_wider()`: convert long data to wide data  
- `separate()`: split a single column into multiple columns  

## Reshaping wide data to long

The `pivot_longer` function requires specifying the columns to pivot using the [`tidyselect`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/tidyr_tidy_select.html) syntax. This syntax is used elsewhere in the tidyverse and is a useful shorthand to avoid listing all columns of interest.   

`pivot_longer(tbl, cols = <...>)`

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap= "Tables from tidyr cheatsheet from https://posit.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tidyr.pdf" }
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/rnabioco/bmsc-7810-pbda/raw/main/_posts/2023-12-01-class-4-reshaping-data-into-a-tidy-format/img/pivot_longer.png")
```

```{r}
table4a
```

```{r}
pivot_longer(table4a, cols = `1999`:`2000`) # pivot columns from 1999 -> 2000
pivot_longer(table4a, cols = -country) # pivot all columns not matching country
```

Let's try it out on the `pop_wide` population data

```{r}
pop_long <- pivot_longer(pop_wide, cols = -country)

pop_long <- pivot_longer(pop_wide, 
                         cols = -country, 
                         names_to = "year",
                         values_to = "population")
```


Why is the useful? Well now we can quickly use `dplyr` to answer questions, such 
as what is the average population per country across all years?

```{r}
library(dplyr)
group_by(pop_long, country) |> 
  summarize(mean_population = mean(population))
```

## Reshaping long data to wide

`pivot_wider(tbl, names_from = <...>, values_from = <...>)`

`names_from`: the column whose values will become new columns in the result.    
`values_from`: the column whose values will be in the new columns.  

```{r, echo = FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/rnabioco/bmsc-7810-pbda/raw/main/_posts/2023-12-01-class-4-reshaping-data-into-a-tidy-format/img/pivot_wider.png")
```
```{r}
table2
```

```{r}
pivot_wider(table2, names_from = type, values_from = count)
```

Try it out with the `pop_long` population  data. 

```{r}

```

## Separate

`separate` is useful for dealing with data in which a single column contains multiple variables.

`seperate(tbl, col = <...>, into = c(<..., ..., ...>), sep = "...")`

`col`: column to split into multiple columns  
`into`: column names of new columns to be generated, supplied as a character vector (use quotes).  
`sep`: the separator used to split values in the `col` column. Can be a character (`_`) or a integer to indicate the character position to split (2).  

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/rnabioco/bmsc-7810-pbda/raw/main/_posts/2023-12-01-class-4-reshaping-data-into-a-tidy-format/img/separate.png")
```

```{r}
table3
```

```{r}
separate(table3, col = rate, into = c("cases", "pop"), sep = "/")
```

## Exercises

Use the [gapminder population dataset](https://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/gd003/) (`pop_long`) to perform the following tasks and answer the following questions:


1) Which country had the highest population in 1810?  

```{r}

```

2) What was the world population in the year 1840?  

```{r}

```

3) Which country had the lowest average population in the 19th century (years 1800-1899)?

```{r}

  
```


## Using binds and joins to aggregate multiple data.frames 

### column binds

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "from the dplyr cheatsheet at https://posit.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/data-transformation-1.pdf"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/rnabioco/bmsc-7810-pbda/raw/main/_posts/2023-12-01-class-4-reshaping-data-into-a-tidy-format/img/bind_cols.png")
```

`bind_cols(tbl_1, tbl_2, ...)`

`bind_cols` will bind the columns from 2 or more tables into 1 table. Note that with column binds you need to ensure that each table has the same number of rows, and that the rows correspond to the same observations.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
tbl1 <- data.frame(x = 1:3)
tbl2 <- data.frame(y = 3:5)
bind_cols(tbl1, tbl2)
```

### row binds

`bind_rows` binds rows from multiple tables into one table. Similarly to `bind_cols` you will want the columns to match between the tables, so that the observations are consistent with the variables. 

`bind_rows(tbl_1, tbl_2, ..., .id = NULL)`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/rnabioco/bmsc-7810-pbda/raw/main/_posts/2023-12-01-class-4-reshaping-data-into-a-tidy-format/img/bind_rows.png")
```

```{r}
df_1 <- data.frame(x = 1:5, y = LETTERS[1:5])
df_2 <- data.frame(x = 11:15, y = LETTERS[6:10])

bind_rows(df_1, df_2)
```

You can also use a list of `data.frames` with `bind_rows`. If the list is named, you can use the `.id` argument to store a column specifying the name of the data.frame in the output. 

```{r}
lst_of_dfs <- list(one = df_1,
                   two = df_2)

bind_rows(lst_of_dfs)

bind_rows(lst_of_dfs, .id = "source_table")
```

## Joins

Join operations are used to join one table with another table by matching the values shared in particular columns. Join operations enable linking of multiple datasets that contain shared values. 

There are multiple way to join two tables, depending on how you want to handle different combinations of values present or missing in two tables.

Assume we have two data.frames called x and y

The following joins add columns from y to x, matching rows based on the matching values in shared columns.

`inner_join(x, y)`: includes all rows in x and y.

`left_join(x, y)`: includes all rows in x.

`right_join(x, y)`: includes all rows in y.

`full_join(x, y)`: includes all rows in x or y.

If a row in x matches multiple rows in y, all the rows in y will 
be returned once for each matching row in x.

Consider our `pop_long` data.frame. What if we wanted to add additional variables to the data.frame, such as the estimated GDP? 

```{r}
pop_long[1:5, ]
```

First we'll read in an additional dataset from `Gapminder` that contains GDP estimates per country over time. Note that these datafiles have been preprocessed using code [here](https://github.com/rnabioco/bmsc-7810-pbda/blob/main/data/class3/get_data.R)

```{r}
# read in and convert to long format
gdp_wide <- read_csv("data/income_per_person.csv")
gdp_long <- pivot_longer(gdp_wide, 
                         -country, 
                         names_to = "year",
                         values_to = "GDP")
gdp_long
```

Now we can use various joins to merge these data.frames into 1 data.frame.

```{r}
# join on country and year columns, keeping rows with values present in both tables
inner_join(gdp_long, pop_long)
```

The `Joining, by = join_by(country, year)` message indicates that the "country" and "year" columns were used to determine matching rows between the two tables. This is auto-detected based on shared column names in the two data.frames. 

You can use the `by` argument to explicitly specify the columns you'd like to join, which is useful if the columns of interest have different names in the two tables. 

```{r}
# same as above, but being explicit about the columns to use for joining.

# note that for joins you DO need to use quotes for the columns
inner_join(gdp_long, pop_long, by = c("country", "year"))

# unless you use the `join_by` helper
inner_join(gdp_long, pop_long, by = join_by(country, year))
```

```{r}
# join on country and year columns, keeping values all values from gdp_long data.frame
left_join(gdp_long, pop_long)
```

```{r}
# join on country and year columns, keeping values all values from gdp_long and pop_long data.frame
full_join(gdp_long, pop_long)
```



## Missing data

Join operations will often generate missing data (e.g. `NA` values). 

### Zeroes, `NA`, `NaN` and `NULL`

+ Don't use use zeroes to represent missing data. `0` is valid observed value.

+ `NA` (Not Available) is most often use to represent missing data.

+ `NaN` (Not a Number) is the result of an undefined operation, e.g. `0 / 0`.

+ `NULL` means "undefined" and is only used in a programming context (i.e., a function that returns `NULL`). You can't put `NULL` values in a data frame.

Let's examine the output from the `full_join()` operation above which generated NA values.

```{r complete}
country_stats <- full_join(gdp_long, pop_long)
country_stats
```
#### Quick check for `NA` values

```{r}
sum(is.na(country_stats))
any(is.na(country_stats))
```

### `filter` with `is.na()`

You can identify variables with `NA` values by combining `filter()` and `is.na()`.

```{r filter_na, eval = FALSE}
# find rows where GDP is NA
filter(country_stats, is.na(GDP))

# find rows where GDP is *not* NA
filter(country_stats, !is.na(GDP))
```

### `na.omit()`

You can remove **all** rows containing `NA` values with `na.omit()`.

```{r na.omit, eval = FALSE}
na.omit(country_stats)
```

### Computing with `NA` values

Instead of removing `NA` values we can instead just exclude `NA` values from operations with a common optional argument `na.rm = TRUE`.

```{r stat_na, eval = FALSE}
x <- c(1, NA, 3)
sum(x)
sum(x, na.rm = TRUE)

# if NAs are present, the result is NA
sum(country_stats$GDP)

# solution: exclude NAs from the calculation
sum(country_stats$GDP, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
group_by(country_stats, country) %>% 
  summarize(avg_GDP = mean(GDP, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Also you can remove `NaN` values by detecting for their presence using `is.nan()`. These values often occur when a summary operation (e.g. mean or sum) is performed on a vector with 0 elements.

```{r}
x <- 1:10
# none are TRUE
x <- x[x > 100]
x
length(x)
mean(x)

mean(c(1, NaN), na.rm = TRUE)
```

### Replacing `NA` values

Let's replace the NA values in the `population` column with a number, such as -1234.

This is an operation that is easy to do with base R `[]` approach.

```{r}
# use is.na to identify NA values to replace with -1234
country_stats$population[is.na(country_stats$population)] <- -1234

country_stats[1:10, ]
```

Alternatively you can use the `ifelse()` base R function.

```{r}
x <- 1:10

ifelse(x < 5, # an expression producing a logical vector 
       5,     # if TRUE, replace with this expression
       x)     # if FALSE replace with this expression
```

Replace `-1234` with `NA` using base R `$` notation to identify columns.

```{r}
country_stats$population <- ifelse(country_stats$population == -1234,
                                   NA,
                                   country_stats$population)
country_stats[1:10, ]
```

The same can also be done with dplyr, in this case replacing `NA` values again with -1234.

```{r}
mutate(country_stats, 
       population = ifelse(is.na(population), 
                           -1234,
                           population)) 
```

### case_when()

If you want to perform more complex operations use `case_when()` from dplyr. `case_when()` is equivalent to performing multiple nested `ifelse()` operations, whereby if the first operation is **not** TRUE, then check for the second condition, repeating for each condition until there are no more statements.

the syntax for case when is :

```r
`case_when(conditional statement ~ "value in result if TRUE",
           conditional statement #2 ~ "another value in result if",
           TRUE ~ "default if neither conditional statement 1 or 2 are TRUE")`
```
        
For a use case, imagine that we wanted to add a new column called `era`, which signified if the year was in the `past`, `present` or `future.` 

```{r}
country_stats |>
  mutate(
    era = case_when(year < 2023 ~ "past",
                    year == 2023 ~ "present",
                    year > 2023 ~ "future")
    )

# same as above, using TRUE on the left side provides a default value.
country_stats |>
  mutate(
    era = case_when(year < 2023 ~ "past",
                    year == 2023 ~ "present",
                    TRUE ~ "future")
    ) 

```
