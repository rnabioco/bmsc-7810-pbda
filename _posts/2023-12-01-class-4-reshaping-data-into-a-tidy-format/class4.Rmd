## Wide versus long data formats

Data can be represented in multiple formats. Today we will discuss two common tabular formats for organizing data for analysis.

Consider the following dataset, which contains GDP estimates per person for countries throughout history. This representation of the data is commonly referred to as 'wide' data format, which is a matrix-like format containing samples or features as rows or columns, with values associated with each sample and feature. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(readr)
gdp_data <- read_csv("data/income_per_person.csv")
gdp_data
```

The wide matrix-like format is very useful and a common format used for statistics and machine learning. Matrices can take advantage of optimized numerical routines and are the data representation of mathematical matrices. We will work with matrices later in class, particularly with their use to generate heatmaps. 

Representing data in a matrix has a few practical implications:  

1) There is only 1 type of data stored in a matrix-like representation (e.g. each cell is the same unit of observation, the GDP per person). To store additional related data types (e.g. the country population) you need to place each new value in an independent matrix.  

2) The matrix-like format does not easily lend itself to more complicated summaries. For example, what if we wanted to average the GDP values for each decade or century? We would write rather complicated code to parse out subsets of columns for each time period, average them, then merge them into a summary table. 

Data in a matrix can be instead formatted into a long (also sometimes called "tidy") format. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tidyr::pivot_longer(gdp_data, 
                    cols = -country, 
                    names_to = "year", 
                    values_to = "gdp")
```

The long format of this data convert the many columns of a matrix into a 3 column data.frame containing 3 variables (`country`, `year`, and `gdp`). 

## Tidy data format

>“Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.” –– Hadley Wickham

A tidy dataset is structured in a manner to be most effectively processed in R using the tidyverse. It makes the data easier to plot, easier to perform computations and perform complex tasks.  

Most data tables that you've worked with are probably not tidy. It takes experience to understand the best way to format the data for data processing. As you work more in R and the tidyverse this will become more natural. 

Tidy data has the following attributes:

1) Each variable must have its own column.  
2) Each observation must have its own row.  
3) Each value must have its own cell.  

What is a variable, what is an observation, and what is a value?

1) A value is a number or word.  

2) Every value belongs to a variable and an observation  

3) A variable contains all values that measure the same attribute (e.g. height, temperature, duration, magnitude) across units.  

4) An observation contains all values measured on the same unit (e.g. the same individual, the same day, the same country, the samegene).  


```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rnabioco/bmsc-7810-pbda/main/_posts/2023-12-01-class-4-reshaping-data-into-a-tidy-format/img/tidydata.png")
```

Shown below is a simple data table in a tidy format, provided by the `tidyr` package. This data table shows the # of TB cases documented by the WHO in a few countries in the years 1999 and 2000.

```{r}
library(tidyr)
table1
```

The same data, represented in wide, matrix-like format, would require 2 tables:

e.g a table with the `cases` values per country.

```{r}
table4a
```
e.g a table with the `population` values per country   

```{r}
table4b
```

What advantages does the tidy format provide? 

1) Easy to generate summaries of the data. 
   e.g. via group_by() -> summarize()  
   
2) Easy to plot the data using the ggplot2 framework (more on that in later classes)

3) Very easy to join multiple data tables based on key values.

Some disadvantages: 

1) Not space efficient  

2) Not intuitive   

3) Doesn't interface well with traditional machine learning and statistical approaches.  


## Converting between long and wide formats using tidyr 

The [`tidyr`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) package provides functionality to convert datasets into tidy formats. 

- `pivot_longer()`: convert wide data to long data  
- `pivot_wider()`: convert long data to wide data  
- `separate()`: split a single column into multiple columns  

## Reshaping wide data to long

The `pivot_longer` function requires specifying the columns to pivot using the [`tidyselect`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/tidyr_tidy_select.html) syntax. This syntax is used elsewhere in the tidyverse and is a useful shorthand to avoid listing all columns of interest.   

`pivot_longer(tbl, cols = <...>)`

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap= "Tables from tidyr cheatsheet from https://posit.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tidyr.pdf" }
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/rnabioco/bmsc-7810-pbda/raw/main/_posts/2023-12-01-class-4-reshaping-data-into-a-tidy-format/img/pivot_longer.png")
```


```{r}
pivot_longer(table4a, cols = `1999`:`2000`) # pivot columns from 1999 -> 2000
pivot_longer(table4a, cols = -country) # pivot all columns not matching country
```
## Reshaping long data to wide

`pivot_wider(tbl, names_from = <...>, values_from = <...>)`

`names_from`: the column whose values will become new columns in the result.    
`values_from`: the column whose values will be in the new columns.  

```{r, echo = FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/rnabioco/bmsc-7810-pbda/raw/main/_posts/2023-12-01-class-4-reshaping-data-into-a-tidy-format/img/pivot_wider.png")
```

```{r}
pivot_wider(table2, names_from = type, values_from = count)
```


## Separate

`separate` is useful for dealing with data in which a single column contains multiple variables.

`seperate(tbl, col = <...>, into = c(<..., ..., ...>), sep = "...")`

`col`: column to split into multiple columns  
`into`: column names of new columns to be generated, supplied as a character vector (use quotes).  
`sep`: the separator used to split values in the `col` column. Can be a character (`_`) or a integer to indicate the character position to split (2).  

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/rnabioco/bmsc-7810-pbda/raw/main/_posts/2023-12-01-class-4-reshaping-data-into-a-tidy-format/img/separate.png")
```

```{r}
separate(table3, col = rate, into = c("cases", "pop"), sep = "/")
```

## Exercises

Use the [gapminder GDP dataset](https://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/gd001/) to perform the following tasks and answer the following questions:

1) Convert the GDP dataset into tidy format. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
gdp_data <- read_csv("data/income_per_person.csv")
...
```

2) Which country had the highest GDP per person in 1985?  

```{r}

```

3) What was the mean worldwide GDP in the year 1999?  

```{r}

```

4) Which country had the highest average GDP in the 19th century?

```{r}

```


## Binds/Joins

### column binds


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "from the dplyr cheatsheet at https://posit.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/data-transformation-1.pdf"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/rnabioco/bmsc-7810-pbda/raw/main/_posts/2023-12-01-class-4-reshaping-data-into-a-tidy-format/img/bind_cols.png")
```

`bind_cols(tbl_1, tbl_2, ...)`

`bind_cols` will bind the columns from 2 or more tables into 1 table. Note that with column binds you need to ensure that each table has the same number of rows, and that the rows correspond to the same observations.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
tbl1 <- data.frame(x = 1:3)
tbl2 <- data.frame(y = 3:5)
bind_cols(tbl1, tbl2)
```

### row binds

`bind_rows` binds rows from multiple tables into one table. Similarly to `bind_cols` you will want the columns to match between the tables, so that the observations are consistent with the variables. 

`bind_rows(tbl_1, tbl_2, ..., .id = NULL)`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/rnabioco/bmsc-7810-pbda/raw/main/_posts/2023-12-01-class-4-reshaping-data-into-a-tidy-format/img/bind_rows.png")
```

```{r}
df_1 <- data.frame(x = 1:5, y = LETTERS[1:5])
df_2 <- data.frame(x = 11:15, y = LETTERS[6:10])

bind_rows(df_1, df_2)
```

You can also use a list of `data.frames` with `bind_rows`. If the list is named, you can use the `.id` argument to store a column specifying the name of the data.frame in the output. 

```{r}
lst_of_dfs <- list(one = df_1,
                   two = df_2)
bind_rows(lst_of_dfs)

bind_rows(lst_of_dfs, .id = "source_table")
```

## Joins

Join operations are used to join one table with another table by matching the values shared in particular columns. Join operations enable linking of multiple datasets that contain shared values. 

There are multiple way to join two tables, depending on how you want to handle different combinations of values present in two tables.

Assume we have two data.frames called x and y

The following joins add columns from y to x, matching rows based on the matching values in shared columns.

`inner_join(x, y)`: includes all rows in x and y.

`left_join(x, y)`: includes all rows in x.

`right_join(x, y)`: includes all rows in y.

`full_join(x, y)`: includes all rows in x or y.

If a row in x matches multiple rows in y, all the rows in y will 
be returned once for each matching row in x.

Consider the following simple tables:

```{r}
animal_class <- data.frame(
  name    = c("cat", "pike", "bear", "dog"),
  genus   = c("Felis", "Esox", "Ursus", "Canis"),
  class   = c("Mammalia", "Actinopterygii", "Mammalia", "Mammalia")
)

animal_class
```

```{r}
animal_species <- data.frame(
  name    = c("bluejay", "cat", "pike", "bear"),
  species = c("cristata", "catus", "lucius", "arctos")
)
animal_species
```

```{r}
# join on name column, keeping values from name columns present in both data.frames
inner_join(animal_class, animal_species)
```

```{r}
# join on name column, keeping values all values from animal_class data.frame
left_join(animal_class, animal_species)
```

```{r}
# join on name column, keeping values all values from animal_class and animal_species data.frame
full_join(animal_class, animal_species)
```

The `Joining, by = "name"` message indicates which columns were used to determine matching rows between the two tables. This is auto-detected based on shared column names. You can use the `by` argument to explicitly specify the columns you'd like to join, which is useful if the columns of interest have different names in the two tables. 

```{r}
# same as above, but being explicitly about the column to use for joining.

# note that for joins you DO need to use quotes for the columns
inner_join(animal_class, animal_species, by = "name")
```

## Missing data

Join operations will often generate missing data (e.g. `NA` values). 

### Zeroes, `NA`, `NaN` and `NULL`

+ Don't use use zeroes to represent missing data. `0` is valid observed value.

+ `NA` (Not Available) is most often use to represent missing data.

+ `NaN` (Not a Number) is the result of an undefined operation, e.g. `0 / 0`.

+ `NULL` means "undefined" and is only used in a programming context (i.e., a function that returns `NULL`). You can't put `NULL` values in a data frame.

Let's examine a data frame with some missing data.

```{r complete}
starwars
```

### `filter` with `is.na()`

You can identify variables with `NA` values by combining `filter()` and `is.na()`.

```{r filter_na, eval = FALSE}
# find rows where mass is NA
filter(starwars, is.na(mass))

# find rows where mass is *not* NA
filter(starwars, !is.na(mass))
```

### `na.omit()`

You can remove **all** rows containing `NA` values with `na.omit()`.

```{r na.omit, eval = FALSE}
na.omit(starwars)
```

### Computing with `NA` values

Exclude `NA` values from operations with `na.rm = TRUE`.

```{r stat_na, eval = FALSE}
starwars$mass
# if NAs are present, the result is NA
sum(starwars$mass)
# solution: drop NAs from the calculation
sum(starwars$mass, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
group_by(starwars, species) %>% 
  summarize(avg_mass = mean(mass, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Also you can remove `NaN` values by detecting for their presence using `is.nan()`. These values occur because a few species don't have any characters with values for the mass column, and computing the mean of an empty vector is NaN.

```{r}
group_by(starwars, species) %>% 
  summarize(avg_mass = mean(mass, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  filter(!is.nan(avg_mass))
```

### Replacing `NA` values

Let's replace the NA values in `hair_color` with a string `missing data`.

```{r}
starwars %>% 
  mutate(new_hair_color = ifelse(is.na(hair_color), 
                                 "missing data",
                                 hair_color)) %>% 
  select(hair_color, new_hair_color)
```

We can also replace with values from another column, such as `species`.

```{r}
starwars %>% 
  mutate(new_hair_color = ifelse(is.na(hair_color), 
                                 species,
                                 hair_color)) %>% 
  select(hair_color, new_hair_color)
```

`ifelse` is a base R function that operates on vectors and is useful when you want to replace single values. 

### case_when()

If you want to perform more complex operations use `case_when()` from dplyr. `case_when()` is equivalent to performing multiple nested ifelse() operations, whereby if the first operation is **not** TRUE, then check for the second condition, repeating for each condition until there are no more statements.

the syntax for case when is :

```r
`case_when(conditional statement ~ "value in result",
           conditional statement #2 ~ "another value in result",
           TRUE ~ "default if neither conditional statement 1 or 2 are TRUE")`
```
        
Here is an example from the documentation. Make a new column called `type`. Return "large" if the height or mass of a character is > 200. If that is not true, then return "robot" if the species is "Droid". If that is not TRUE, then default to returning "other".

```{r}
starwars %>%
  select(name:mass, species) %>%
  mutate(type = case_when(height > 200 | mass > 200 ~ "large",
                          species == "Droid"        ~ "robot",
                          TRUE                      ~ "other"))
```

### Using group_by() to replace NAs with summaries from the data

Lastly, it may be beneficial to replace the NA values with a summary value representative of the data. This is an example of data "imputation". 

For example we might decide that we want to replace NA values in the "mass" column with the average mass of the species of the character.

Using group_by() + mutate() is a useful paradigm for performing this operation:  

```{r}
starwars %>% 
  select(name, mass, species) %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  mutate(avg_mass = mean(mass, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(imputed_mass = ifelse(is.na(mass), avg_mass, mass))
```
